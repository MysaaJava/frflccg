# Projet 2-27-1 Computational Structures and Logics for Natural Language Modelling

This project is packed in a jupyter notebook, along with answers to the questions. To run the notebook, you have to install jupyter notebooks and run `jupyter-notebook Report.ipynb`.

### Files

The different files of the repository are the following:
- `Report.ipynb` : The code and answers to the questions, and remarks about the code
- `ccg.ods` : A Spreadsheet describing the grammar we created, with its semantics
- `phrases.txt` : A set of grammatical sentences that should be successfully parsed by our grammar.
- `randomizedTests.txt` :Â A set of sentences generated randomly, mostly to check the strictness of the grammar

### Run the project

You will need to install the following packages in order to run the code from the notebook:
- nltk
- pandas
- jupyter
